This project goes more into depth within the gitbash to help further our knowledge.
For starters in the the date command my datat showed "Fri, Oct 2,2020 10:36:42 PM while 
the tutorial steps showed "Fri 31 Mar 11:44:46 AEDT 2017" which is just a different type of 
formatting. In the next step with the cal command I could not get the function to work properly I
tried searching the web for answers and came across the cal -m for month but in my gitbash command 
would still not function correctly. The next steps such as pwd and ls however did work just as 
expected. Scripting is the next step which is taking the information from the last steps and using
nano helps wrote text better and easier. In the what is bash step basically is over is showing
which bash and locating the information and rewriting on top of the date code with the echo
command. In the file names and permissions step showed how we went throught the file hello-world
and made sure it was accepted then we copied that same file and renamed to add 0_xvz which
executed since we had permission to the file. Then we undid the echo step and and went back
intofile 0_xvz which went into a ASCII text which is the American Standard code for 
information interchange. The script execution elaborates more into the file and permission step
based on how the file was executed. The $ bash date.sh is case sensitative and is a crucial step
in bash shell script. Relative vs Absolute Path steps is about going into files and then seeing
where you currently located at and we used cd to change the directory and go into a different
area.
